## SessionFactory
It is usually created during application start up and kept for later use. You would need one SessionFactory object per database using a separate configuration file. So, if you are using multiple databases, then you would have to create multiple SessionFactory objects.

- thread safe object and used by all the threads of an application.

## Session 
A Session is used to get a physical connection with a database. The Session object is lightweight and designed to be instantiated each time an interaction is needed with the database. Persistent objects are saved and retrieved through a Session object.

- Not Thread safe : The session objects should not be kept open for a long time because they are not usually thread safe and they should be created and destroyed them as needed
